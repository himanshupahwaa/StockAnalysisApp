Back in my undergrad, I created a machine learning model to analyze public sentiment based on Twitter data and financial news. Using NLP techniques and sentiment analysis libraries, I could determine whether the general sentiment was positive, neutral, or negative. Although this provided useful insights, the model was still limited—it couldn’t comprehend the nuance or context behind a statement. 
But now, using an LLM, I could shift from basic sentiment analysis to a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying meaning of news articles. This web app not only identified the tone but also made context-based predictions. For instance, news about a product recall now triggered more informed deductions about a stock's potential decline. In my latest project, I’ve integrated LLM-powered deductions into stock analysis. Now, when a news article related to a stock is released, the system evaluates whether the content is positive or negative and makes a semi-concrete deduction on its potential impact while holding context from other related articles. For instance, negative earnings reports for a company like APPL may trigger a decline, but it may still recommend buying for the long term due to its strong fundamentals. I believe that a system like this can empower new traders and investors with better-informed decision-making capabilities by giving a concise analysis, which news articles often fall short of.
